    "# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets\n",
    "\n",
    "Our aim in this project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. We're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps, and our job is to enable our team of developers to make data-driven decisions with respect to the kind of apps they build.\n",
    "\n",
    "At our company, we only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collecting data for over 4 million apps requires a significant amount of time and money, so we'll try to analyze a sample of the data instead. To avoid spending resources on collecting new data ourselves, we should first try to see if we can find any relevant existing data at no cost. Luckily, here are two datasets that seem suitable for our goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately 10,000 Android apps from Google Play; the data was collected in August 2018. You can download the dataset directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately 7,000 iOS apps from the App Store; the data was collected in July 2017. You can download the dataset directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by opening and exploring these two datasets. To make them easier for you to explore, we created a function named `explore_data()` that you can repeatedly use to print rows in a readable way."

    "Examining the Apple App Store's 'Prime Genre' frequency table, we see that among the free English apps, more than a half (58.16%) are games. Entertainment apps are close to 8%, followed by photo and video apps, which are close to 5%. Only 3.66% of the apps are designed for education, followed by social networking apps which amount for 3.29% of the apps in our data set.\n",

    "The general impression is that App Store (at least the part containing free English apps) is dominated by apps that are designed for fun (games, entertainment, photo and video, social networking, sports, music, etc.), while apps with practical purposes (education, shopping, utilities, productivity, lifestyle, etc.) are more rare. However, the fact that fun apps are the most numerous doesn't also imply that they also have the greatest number of users — the demand might not be the same as the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the Genres and Category columns of the Google Play data set, The landscape seems significantly different on Google Play: there are not that many apps designed for fun, and it seems that a good number of apps are designed for practical purposes (family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.). However, if we investigate this further, we can see that the family category (which accounts for almost 19% of the apps) means mostly games for kids.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to find out what genres are the most popular (have the most users) is to calculate the average number of installs for each app genre. For the Google Play dataset, we can find this information in the Installs column, but this information is missing for the App Store dataset. As a workaround, we'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy, which we can find in the rating_count_tot app.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with calculating the average number of user ratings per app genre on the App Store. To do that, we'll need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Isolate the apps of each genre\n",
    "- Add up the user ratings for the apps of that genre\n",
    "- Divide the sum by the number of apps belonging to that genre (not by the total number of apps)"
